# HTML Report Demo Videos

This directory contains recorded demonstrations of the ops-translate HTML report interactive features.

## Recording New Demos

Use the recording script in the project root:

```bash
# Record demo mode test (recommended)
./record-demo.sh

# Record all tests
./record-demo.sh --all

# Interactive recording (codegen mode)
./record-demo.sh --codegen
```

## Demo Videos

Videos demonstrate:
- Card-based filtering by classification level
- Filter indicator show/hide
- Gap item visibility based on filters
- Clear filter functionality
- Interactive UI walkthrough

## Format

Videos are recorded in WebM format and optionally converted to MP4 for better compatibility:
- **WebM**: Native Playwright recording format, smaller file size
- **MP4**: H.264/AAC encoding for universal playback

## Usage

Include these videos in documentation, presentations, or demos to showcase the HTML report's interactive features without requiring a live environment.
